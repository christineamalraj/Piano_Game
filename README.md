This is a piano game where you enter a song from the list that pops up and the program walks you through which notes to play one at a time. If you get the note correct, the notre plays and you get a point. If you get the note wrong, you lose a point and get to try again. The program ends when you make it to the end of a song.
Here's a copy of the list of song options:
Frere Jacques
Ode to Joy
Twinkle Twinkle Little Star
Mary had a Little Lamb
Happy Birthday
